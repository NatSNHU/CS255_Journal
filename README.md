Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a driving instruction client who wanted to provide a cloud-based web-service for their students to purchase and make reservations online. 

What did you do particularly well?

My main skills are analysis and design. So I would say that despite a few setbacks, all the work that I have done has been done very well. Systems are a lot like machines which is essentially engineering. So when I look at a system there's a certain level of understanding to learn
and know how objects function and how they should be interacting with each other to work efficiently.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

It would have to be the business requirements doc. I never did finish the assignment, so for starters I would go back and finish it. Majority of the work for the system design doc was diagrams, if needed I 
could have spent a bit more time modifying those as well to fully implement the system as a whole.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We use web sites nearly every day, so it's a matter of noticing the useful features and implementing them as needed, as well as noticing the features that aren’t as useful and taking them into consideration when designing a new system.
 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Start with the design concept. Identify the functional requirements, and objects that are a part of the system. From there, carefully analyze the relationships between the objects and the functions they must execute.
